## Introduction

### Abstract

The solar energy industry has seen considerable advancements over the past decade, yet the generation of renewable energy remains unpredictable. This unpredictability presents significant challenges in managing energy supply and demand. The objective of this project is to enhance business efficiency by forecasting the power output of a solar farm, thereby improving the management of energy supply, demand, and pricing in this volatile sector.

The project aims to develop a solar energy forecasting system based on data mining principles. Using a limited set of weather variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), the system intends to predict the power generated by a solar power plant 24 hours in advance and quantify future uncertainties.

### Problem Statement

In the current energy landscape, prices are increasingly volatile, prompting businesses to modernize their models to address this issue. The project proposes creating a model to predict solar power output based on specific weather conditions. This model will help understand and quantify the uncertainties in solar energy production, enabling better decision-making for energy management.

Key challenges include understanding how various weather conditions impact the power output of a solar farm, especially considering the size and number of solar panels. Developing a probabilistic forecast involves handling initial data, selecting optimal regression classifiers, and integrating multiple forecasts to generate a more accurate prediction.

## [Implemented Methods](#implemented-methods)

**Dataset Splitting**  
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets. The training set covers data from April 1, 2012, to July 1, 2013, while the testing set includes data from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2014.

**Feature Selection**  
To enhance model performance, the dataset’s features were analyzed to determine the most impactful weather variables. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between each weather variable and power output, leading to adjustments in the model based on these correlations. Key variables such as 2-meter temperature and 10-meter wind components were identified as significant predictors.

**Data Preprocessing**  
Data standardization was performed to transform raw data into a suitable format for modeling. Each weather variable was standardized using the formula:

Standard Score = (X - μ) / σ

where:
- `X` is the value of the weather variable,
- `μ` is the mean of the training samples, and
- `σ` is the standard deviation of the training samples.

**Model Selection**  
Initially, a Lasso linear model was employed due to its effectiveness with datasets containing numerous features. After evaluating its performance, an ensemble model using a random forest regressor was adopted, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.

**Generalization Ability**  
5-fold cross-validation was used to determine the optimal hyperparameters for the random forest regressor. The model was trained and tested on the dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
