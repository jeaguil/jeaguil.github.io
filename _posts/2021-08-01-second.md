The PatrolBot project is about creating a semi-autonomous surveillance robot that will provide an essential
tool for campus police. The goal is for the robot to scout bike racks around campus to look for any elements of
bike theft. Governed by object detection models, threat computation algorithms and a back-end web server,
the robot will help alleviate some pressure on campus police.
