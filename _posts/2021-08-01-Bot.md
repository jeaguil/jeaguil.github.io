title: Building a Semi-Autonomous Surveillance bot
---

The Patrol Bot project aims to create a surveillance robot that scout bike racks around campus to detect any elements of bike theft. Governed by object detection models, threat computation algorithms, and a back-end web server, the robot attempts to alleviate some of the pressure on campus police.

## Web Server

The web application provides a centralized hub for all project pieces and intends to streamline communication between the user and all system aspects. Backed by the Django web framework and hosted using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the web server includes the camera feed sent from the robot to the website through AWS Kinesis, as well as GPS coordinates and movement requests through AWS IoT. The website also contains past recordings and captured frames of malicious individual behavior for future viewing.

## Robot

The robot is governed by Ubuntu 18.04 and uses ROS Melodic, as well as the AWS Python SDK, to provide the necessary information. The robot's hardware consists of...

* 4WD Rover Zero 3 Robot
* Raspberry Pi 4 that serves as the robot controller for processing local communication to the web server
* Raspberry Pi 3B+ for camera communication
* Stemedu VK172 - GPS Module
* Charmcast 10000mAH - Portable Battery to power both Raspberry Pis

## Machine Learning

### Object Detection Model

A custom object detection model utilizing YOLOv5 architecture to detect:

* People
* Bikes
* Malicious objects like angle grinders and bolt cutters

We utilized Roboflow to create a custom dataset that consists of bike-theft scenarios with the objects listed above as primary interests and performed image augmentation.

### Action Detect Model

Inflated 3D convolutional neural network was trained on a dataset containing
normal crowd behavior vs aggressive individual behavior. The intention is to classify vigorous behavior that needs to be immediately addressed a security official.

### Threat Detection Algorithm

An algorithm is used to compute potential threats and notify a user if a bike theft is likely in progress. This algorithm utilizes the fundamentals of intersection-over-union of bounding boxes provided by the object detection model to determine if a potential threat exceeds a certain threat threshold.
