Hello, and welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Jesus Aguilera and I am currently a senior computer science and engineering major attending the University of Nevada, Reno. I consider myself a diligent programmer that has a passion for aerospace, robotics, big data analytics and all the technologies that involve a large set of complex data. My career related goal is to put proven skills to help utilize data for business growth or expand the understanding of modern space research!
